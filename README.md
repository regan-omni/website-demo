Built with Gemini Deepmind 
(powered by Three.js)

## PROMPT ✨ :

```
Create a real-time interactive 3D particle system with Three.js.
requirements:

1. Control the scaling and expansion of the particle group by detecting the tension and closing of both hands through the camera.

2. Provide panels that can choose hearts/particles/saturn/dna/fireworks, and other templates

3. Support the colour selector to adjust the particle colour

4. Particles need to respond to gesture changes in real time.

5. The interface is simple and modern
